The dataset includes 11 different texture classes (Grass lawn, Pressed calf leather, Handmade paper, Raffia looped to a high pile, Cotton canvas, Pigskin, Beach sand, Oriental straw cloth, Oriental grass fiber cloth) with 500 instances per class, totaling 5,500 instances. Each instance is described by 40 attributes representing fourth-order modified moments estimated in four orientations (0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 135\u00b0). Each example contains 40 features.
