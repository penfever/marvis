  "task_prefix": "The Statlog Vehicle Silhouettes dataset contains features extracted from 2D silhouettes of four types of vehicles. The purpose is to classify vehicle silhouettes using shape features extracted by the HIPS (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which combines classical moment-based measures and heuristic shape descriptors. Each example contains 18 features. Vehicle type classification from silhouettes for applications in traffic monitoring.",
