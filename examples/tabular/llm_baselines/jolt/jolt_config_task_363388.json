It contains conversations where personas interact in a fantasy-themed environment. The dataset is specifically processed to study multi-dimensional gender bias by analyzing how language differs based on the speaker's gender, the addressee's gender, and who is being discussed. Each example contains 5 features. Predict the ternary_score.",
