SRUs are critical environmental protection systems that remove harmful sulfur compounds from acid gas streams in industrial processes, particularly in oil refineries and natural gas plants. The system converts toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into elemental sulfur, which can be safely handled and sold as a chemical product. Each example contains 7 features. Predict the y1.",
