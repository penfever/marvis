  "task_prefix": "Letter recognition dataset where the objective is to identify black-and-white rectangular pixel displays as one of the 26 capital letters in the English alphabet. Character images were based on 20 different fonts with random distortions to produce 20,000 unique stimuli. Each stimulus was converted into 16 primitive numerical attributes using statistical moments and edge counts. Each example contains 16 features. Optical character recognition (OCR) for identifying capital letters from pixel displays. Applications include document digitization.",
