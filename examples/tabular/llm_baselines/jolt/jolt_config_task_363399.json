  "task_prefix": "This dataset contains molecular descriptors and bioconcentration factors (BCF) for various chemical compounds. It's used to develop Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models to predict how chemicals accumulate in aquatic organisms relative to their concentration in water. This is crucial for environmental risk assessment and toxicology studies. Each example contains 11 features. Predict the logBCF.",
