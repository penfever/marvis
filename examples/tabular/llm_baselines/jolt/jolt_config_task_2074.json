The database contains spectral data from four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands (two visible, two near-infrared). The task is to predict the soil type classification of the central pixel based on multi-spectral values. Each example contains 1 features. Land cover classification from satellite imagery. Applications include agricultural monitoring.",
