  "dataset_name": "eucalyptus",
  "task_prefix": "This dataset aims to determine which eucalyptus seedlots in various species are best for soil conservation in seasonally dry hill country of New Zealand. Data was collected from various trial sites across the North Island, measuring tree growth characteristics, survival rates, and site conditions. The utility rating indicates overall suitability for soil conservation purposes. Each example contains 19 features. Predict the target class.",
