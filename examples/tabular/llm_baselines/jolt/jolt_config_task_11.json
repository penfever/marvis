  "task_prefix": "Balance Scale Weight & Distance Database generated to model psychological experimental results. Each example represents a balance scale scenario with weights and distances on both sides. The task is to predict whether the scale tips left, tips right, or remains balanced based on the physics principle of torque. Each example contains 4 features. Modeling cognitive development and understanding how children learn physical principles. Used to study machine learning approaches to cognitive modeling and rule learning..",
