  "dataset_name": "wall-robot-navigation",
  "task_prefix": "This dataset contains sensor readings collected from a SCITOS G5 mobile robot navigating through a room following walls in a clockwise direction. The robot uses 24 ultrasound sensors arranged circularly around its waist. The dataset includes simplified distance measurements (front, left, right, back) derived from minimum sensor readings within 60-degree arcs. The task is to predict the appropriate navigation action based on these sensor readings. Each example contains 4 features. Predict the target class.",
