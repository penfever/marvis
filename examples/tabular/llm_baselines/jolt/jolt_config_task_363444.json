Rice cultivation is a significant source of anthropogenic methane emissions, and this data helps understand and predict emission patterns based on various environmental and agricultural factors. The data appears to be compiled from FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) sources. Each example contains 2 features. Predict the Value.",
