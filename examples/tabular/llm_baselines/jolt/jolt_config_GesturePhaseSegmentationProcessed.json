  "dataset_name": "GesturePhaseSegmentationProcessed",
  "task_prefix": "This dataset contains processed features extracted from videos of people performing gestures, aimed at studying gesture phase segmentation. The processed data includes velocity and acceleration measurements of hands and wrists during gesture performance. The goal is to classify different phases of gesture execution, which is important for gesture recognition and human-computer interaction applications. Each example contains 32 features. Predict the target class.",
