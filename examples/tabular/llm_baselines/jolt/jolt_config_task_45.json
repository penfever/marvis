Contains 60-nucleotide sequences centered around splice junctions, with the task of classifying exon/intron boundaries (EI sites) and intron/exon boundaries (IE sites). Each example contains 1 features. Gene structure prediction and annotation in genomic sequences. Applications include identifying protein-coding regions.",
