  "task_prefix": "The banknote authentication dataset contains features extracted from images of genuine and forged banknote specimens using Wavelet Transform tool. Data were collected from 400x400 pixel grayscale images at 660 dpi resolution taken with an industrial camera for print inspection. The dataset is used to distinguish between authentic and counterfeit banknotes. Each example contains 4 features. Authentication of banknotes to detect counterfeits using image processing features.",
