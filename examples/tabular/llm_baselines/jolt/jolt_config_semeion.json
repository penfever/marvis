  "task_prefix": "The Semeion dataset contains handwritten digits (0-9) from around 80 persons. Each digit was scanned and stretched into a 16x16 pixel rectangular box in grayscale (256 values), then binarized using a fixed threshold. Each person wrote all digits 0-9 twice: once normally (with accuracy) and once quickly (without accuracy). This results in 1,593 handwritten digit images represented as binary pixel values. Each example contains 256 features. Predict the target class.",
