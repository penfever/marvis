It contains persona-based conversations from the ConvAI2 competition, specifically annotated and analyzed for gender-related attributes and biases. The data represents conversations where personas contain gender-identifiable information, which has been annotated both manually and through automated classification. Each example contains 5 features. Predict the ternary_score.",
