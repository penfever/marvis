  "task_prefix": "Dataset for predicting Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values of antibiotics against bacterial strains. MIC represents the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that inhibits visible growth of a microorganism after incubation. Each example contains 9 features. Predict the target class.",
  "column_descriptions": {
    "bacterial_strain": "Specific bacterial species and strain identifier. Includes common pathogens like E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus.",
    "antibiotic": "Name of the antimicrobial agent tested. Includes various classes: beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, etc.",
    "antibiotic_class": "Broad classification of antibiotic mechanism. Groups drugs by mode of action (cell wall synthesis inhibitors, protein synthesis inhibitors, etc.).",
    "molecular_weight": "Molecular weight of the antibiotic compound in Daltons. Affects drug penetration and pharmacokinetics.",
    "logP": "Octanol-water partition coefficient. Indicates lipophilicity affecting membrane permeability.",
    "bacterial_features": "Genomic or phenotypic features of the bacterial strain. May include resistance genes, virulence factors, or growth characteristics.",
    "testing_method": "Laboratory method used: broth microdilution, agar dilution, or E-test. Affects precision and range of MIC values.",
    "MIC_value": "Minimum Inhibitory Concentration in \u03bcg/mL. Target variable representing antibiotic effectiveness.",
    "resistance_phenotype": "Clinical interpretation: Susceptible, Intermediate, or Resistant based on breakpoint criteria."
