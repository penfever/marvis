Images were preprocessed from 32x32 bitmaps divided into 4x4 non-overlapping blocks, counting pixels in each block to generate 8x8 input matrices with integer values 0-16. This dimensionality reduction provides invariance to small distortions. Each example contains 1 features. Optical character recognition (OCR) for handwritten digit recognition. Applications include postal code reading.",
