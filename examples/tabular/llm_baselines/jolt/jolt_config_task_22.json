  "dataset_name": "mfeat-zernike",
  "task_prefix": "This dataset is part of the Multiple Features Dataset collection, containing features of handwritten numerals (0-9) extracted from Dutch utility maps. Specifically, this dataset contains 47 Zernike moment features, which are rotation-invariant shape descriptors. Each of the 10 digit classes has 200 instances digitized from binary images. Note: Zernike moments cannot distinguish between digits '6' and '9' due to their rotational similarity. Each example contains 47 features. Predict the target class.",
