  "task_prefix": "A materials science dataset containing properties of superconducting materials and their critical temperatures. The dataset is used to predict the temperature at which materials transition to a superconducting state based on various physical and chemical properties. This is valuable for materials discovery and design of new superconductors. Each example contains 5 features. Predict the criticaltemp.",
