The data is derived from CASP 5-9 protein structure prediction experiments. Each example contains 10 features. Predict the target class.",

    "RMSD": "Root Mean Square Deviation of the predicted tertiary structure from the native structure. Target variable measuring structural similarity (lower values indicate better predictions).",
    "F1": "Total surface area of the protein structure. Represents the overall size and exposed regions of the folded protein.",
    "F2": "Non-polar exposed area. Indicates hydrophobic regions on the protein surface, important for protein-protein interactions and stability.",
    "F3": "Fractional area of exposed non-polar residue. Ratio of hydrophobic surface to total surface area.",
    "F4": "Fractional area of exposed non-polar part of residue. More detailed measure of hydrophobic exposure at residue level.",
    "F5": "Molecular mass weighted exposed area. Accounts for the size of exposed residues in surface area calculations.",
    "F6": "Average deviation from standard exposed area of residue. Measures how much the structure deviates from typical exposure patterns.",
    "F7": "Euclidean distance. Geometric measure of structural differences between predicted and native conformations.",
    "F8": "Secondary structure penalty. Quantifies deviations in alpha-helix and beta-sheet formations from the native structure.",
    "F9": "Spatial distribution constraints (N,K Value). Measures how well the predicted structure maintains proper spatial relationships between residues."
