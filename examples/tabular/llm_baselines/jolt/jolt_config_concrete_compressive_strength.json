{
  "dataset_name": "concrete_compressive_strength",
  "task_prefix": "High-performance concrete mixture data for predicting compressive strength. Contains quantities of raw materials (cement, water, etc.) and age to predict the resulting concrete strength, a critical parameter in civil engineering. Each example contains 9 features. Predict the target class.",
  "column_descriptions": {
    "Cement": "Cement content (component 1) - primary binding material in concrete. Higher amounts generally increase strength.",
    "BlastFurnaceSlag": "Blast furnace slag (component 2) - industrial byproduct used as partial cement replacement. Improves durability and long-term strength.",
    "FlyAsh": "Fly ash (component 3) - coal combustion byproduct used as supplementary cementitious material. Enhances workability and durability.",
    "Water": "Water content (component 4) - activates cement hydration. Water-cement ratio is crucial for strength development.",
    "Superplasticizer": "Superplasticizer (component 5) - chemical admixture that improves workability without adding water. Allows lower water-cement ratios.",
    "CoarseAggregate": "Coarse aggregate (component 6) - large particles (gravel/crushed stone) providing bulk and strength to concrete.",
    "FineAggregate": "Fine aggregate (component 7) - sand that fills voids between coarse aggregates and improves workability.",
    "Age": "Age of concrete in days. Concrete strength increases with curing time, typically tested at 28 days.",
    "CompressiveStrength": "Concrete compressive strength in MPa (megapascals). Target variable measured using cylindrical specimens (15cm x 30cm)."
