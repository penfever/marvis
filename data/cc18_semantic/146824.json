  "dataset_history": "Data Collection: Handwritten numerals extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. Original binary images were digitized and sampled to create 15x16 pixel versions.",
  "inference_notes": "Challenges: High dimensionality (240 features), sensitive to translation and scaling, may capture noise in pixel values. Advantages: Pixel features provide direct spatial information, intuitive interpretation, good baseline for comparison with other feature types. Applications: Multiple feature learning, feature fusion, classifier combination, comparative studies of feature representations. Use Case: Handwritten digit recognition for document processing, postal automation, bank check processing, form digitization, and multiple feature learning studies"
