  "description": "The electricity dataset contains data from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market, where prices are not fixed and are affected by demand and supply. Prices are set every five minutes. The dataset includes electricity transfers between New South Wales and Victoria states to alleviate fluctuations. Each instance represents a 30-minute period with demand, price, and transfer information.",
