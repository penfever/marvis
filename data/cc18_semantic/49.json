  "dataset_history": "Classic benchmark dataset for machine learning, particularly for testing constructive induction and feature engineering. CITRE algorithm achieved high accuracy through automatic feature construction. Dataset demonstrates that simple decision trees struggle without feature engineering, while instance-based and rule-based methods perform well.",
  "inference_notes": "Contains 958 instances representing all legal tic-tac-toe endgame boards. Each attribute has 3 possible values: 'x' (X played), 'o' (O played), 'b' (blank). About 65.3% positive class (X wins). The 8 winning patterns are: 3 rows, 3 columns, and 2 diagonals. Perfect domain for studying relational patterns and feature construction in machine learning."
