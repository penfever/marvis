  "description": "Landsat satellite image dataset consisting of multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighborhoods. The database contains spectral data from four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands (two visible, two near-infrared). The task is to predict the soil type classification of the central pixel based on multi-spectral values.",
