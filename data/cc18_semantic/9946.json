  "dataset_history": "Created using the Xcyt image analysis system to extract nuclear features from FNA slides. Features selected through exhaustive search in 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes space. Used Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) with linear programming for classification. Original work achieved 97.5% accuracy (369/370 correct). The one misclassified case was likely due to missing the tumor during aspiration. Dataset became a benchmark for ML algorithms in medical diagnosis.",
  "inference_notes": "Each of 10 nuclear features computed three ways: mean (average across all nuclei), standard error (variability measure), and worst (mean of three largest values). 'Worst' features capture extreme cases that may indicate malignancy. Fractal dimension uses 'coastline approximation' to quantify boundary complexity - malignant nuclei often have more irregular boundaries. Compactness formula (perimeter²/area - 1) normalized so circle = 0. Features are scale-invariant and rotation-invariant, important for robust image analysis."
