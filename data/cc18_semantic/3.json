  "dataset_history": "Developed by Alen Shapiro in 1983 as part of his Ph.D. thesis 'The Role of Structured Induction in Expert Systems' at University of Edinburgh. Used to demonstrate structured induction methodology for extracting expert knowledge. The endgame was chosen as it was difficult enough to challenge master players but tractable for analysis. Became a standard UCI benchmark dataset.",
  "inference_notes": "The exact semantic meanings of all 36 attributes are documented in Shapiro's 1987 book 'Structured Induction in Expert Systems' (Addison-Wesley) but this source is not readily available digitally. The attribute names follow clear patterns: 'bk' prefix for black king features, 'wk' for white king, 'r' for rook-related features. Many attributes encode chess concepts like opposition, zugzwang, skewer tactics, and control of key squares. The binary encoding (t/f) simplifies complex positional judgments. Some attributes like 'bkxwp' and 'rkxwp' reference white pawns that don't exist in this endgame, suggesting these may be generalized features from a broader chess encoding system."
