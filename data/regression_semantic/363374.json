It was initially shared on Kaggle in 2018 and has since been used in various research studies, particularly in multi-modal machine learning applications combining text and tabular data. The retailer's identity remains anonymous to protect business interests.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations include:\n1. Potential selection bias as only customers who chose to write reviews are represented\n2. Class imbalance may exist in ratings (typically more positive than negative reviews in e-commerce)\n3. Text features contain subjective opinions and varying writing styles\n4. Temporal aspects (fashion trends, seasonal variations) may influence ratings\n5. The relationship between positive feedback count and rating may have complex interactions\n6. Department and classification features may have hierarchical relationships\n7. Recommended IND may be strongly correlated with rating",
