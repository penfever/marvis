  "dataset_history": "The dataset appears to be compiled from World Bank and FAO historical records, combining multiple agricultural and economic indicators. It was created to support analysis of global food security, agricultural production trends, and economic development patterns over approximately 60-70 years. The data collection spans 150+ unique crops and 50+ livestock elements, making it a comprehensive resource for agricultural economic analysis.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations:\n1. The dataset likely combines multiple data sources and collection methodologies over its temporal span\n2. Different regions may have varying data quality and collection standards\n3. Historical data may have inconsistencies or gaps, especially for earlier periods\n4. The large number of instances (1.7M+) suggests detailed granularity but may require careful aggregation for analysis\n5. Feature names are numeric (0-5) which limits immediate interpretability without additional context\n6. The combination of agricultural and economic data may require domain expertise for proper interpretation\n7. Different measurement units and scales across variables may necessitate careful normalization",
