  "dataset_history": "This appears to be a synthetic dataset created to simulate the complex relationships between climate change and agricultural economics. It incorporates various factors known to influence agricultural resilience and productivity in the face of climate change, based on established research in agricultural economics and climate science.",
  "inference_notes": "As a synthetic dataset, it may not capture all real-world complexities and local variations. The relationships between variables are likely based on simplified models of known climate-agriculture interactions. Users should consider that actual climate impacts can be more complex and region-specific. The dataset appears designed for educational purposes and preliminary modeling rather than definitive policy decisions.",
