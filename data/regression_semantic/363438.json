  "inference_notes": "Important considerations include:\n1. Reddit's demographic biases (predominantly younger, male, Western users)\n2. Potential sampling biases based on keyword selection for climate-related content\n3. Vote manipulation and bot activity may affect metrics\n4. Temporal patterns may be significant (daily/seasonal variations)\n5. Community-specific norms in different subreddits may affect voting patterns\n6. Not all features from the original 24 could be definitively identified without direct access to the complete data dictionary\n7. The large number of instances (>1M) suggests good statistical power but may include noise and duplicate content",
