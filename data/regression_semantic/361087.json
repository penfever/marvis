  "inference_notes": "Important considerations include:\n1. The data represents only single-family homes, excluding condos and multi-family units\n2. Aviation noise measurements may have seasonal variations\n3. Property prices in Miami can be influenced by factors not captured in the dataset (e.g., hurricane risk, flood zones)\n4. The 2016 timeframe represents a specific point in Miami's real estate cycle\n5. Distance measurements may not account for actual travel time or accessibility\n6. Some luxury properties or unusual sales may create outliers in the price distribution",
