  "dataset_history": "The dataset appears to be compiled from various international and national sources tracking hunger and nutrition metrics in Pakistan. It likely combines data from the World Health Organization (WHO), World Bank development indicators, and Pakistan's national statistics bureau. The collection period (2020-2023) coincides with significant global food security challenges, including COVID-19 impacts and economic instability.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations include: 1) Data may have regional variations within Pakistan that are not captured in these national-level metrics, 2) Some metrics like Food_Production_Index may have seasonal variations, 3) Rural vs urban disparities might significantly impact interpretation, 4) COVID-19 period (2020-2021) may show unusual patterns, 5) Data collection methods and definitions may vary between sources, 6) Economic indicators should be considered alongside social metrics for comprehensive analysis. The target variable (Children_Underweight) is a key indicator of long-term nutritional challenges and effectiveness of food security programs.",
