  "dataset_history": "This dataset was collected as part of a larger research effort studying yellow drum (Nibea albiflora), an economically important marine fish species in East Asia. The data collection was performed to understand survival characteristics and their relationship with various phenotypic traits, which is crucial for aquaculture optimization and breeding programs. The dataset was later adapted for machine learning purposes and uploaded to OpenML.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations:\n1. The dataset has been cleaned to remove NaN values specifically in the target variable (Survive_time)\n2. The original feature names and their specific meanings are not provided in the OpenML documentation\n3. The data represents biological measurements, which typically have natural variability and potential measurement uncertainties\n4. The dataset is relatively small (180 instances) which may impact model generalization\n5. Without detailed feature descriptions, careful feature selection and domain expertise may be required for meaningful analysis\n6. The data appears to be from a controlled study environment, which may affect generalizability to wild populations",
