  "dataset_history": "This dataset was compiled from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, which has been collecting standardized crime statistics from law enforcement agencies across the United States since 1930. The county-level focus provides a more granular view than state-level statistics, while the long time period (41 years) enables analysis of long-term trends and patterns in crime rates.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations include:\n1. Reporting inconsistencies between jurisdictions and over time\n2. Not all crimes are reported to law enforcement\n3. Changes in crime definitions and reporting standards over the time period\n4. Population changes can affect raw crime counts\n5. Socioeconomic factors not captured in the data may influence crime rates\n6. Some counties may have missing data for certain years\n7. Rural vs urban differences in reporting capabilities and practices",
