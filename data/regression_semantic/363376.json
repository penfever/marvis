  "dataset_history": "This dataset was created to study the relationship between article characteristics and their viral potential on social media. It was collected from Mashable.com during 2013-2015 using their public API and web scraping techniques. The dataset has become a benchmark for studying content virality prediction and digital journalism analytics.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations include:\n1. The logarithmic transformation of shares helps handle the highly skewed nature of viral content distribution\n2. The predictive power is intentionally limited to pre-publication features to enable proactive decision making\n3. There may be temporal effects and changing social media dynamics not captured in the features\n4. The dataset represents a specific time period and single news source, which may limit generalizability\n5. The relationship between article characteristics and sharing behavior is inherently noisy and influenced by many external factors not captured in the dataset",
