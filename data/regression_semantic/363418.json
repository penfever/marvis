  "dataset_name": "infrared_thermography_temperature",
  "description": "This dataset contains thermal imaging measurements and related metadata collected to study the relationship between infrared thermography readings and core body temperature. The data was collected using thermal cameras to measure surface temperatures at various facial points, combined with traditional oral temperature measurements, with the goal of developing non-contact temperature screening methods.",

  "dataset_history": "This dataset was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic to evaluate the effectiveness of thermal imaging for fever screening. The research was conducted to support the development of guidelines for non-contact temperature measurement systems, which became crucial for public health screening during the pandemic. The data collection followed standardized protocols established by international standards organizations.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations include:\n1. Thermal readings can be affected by environmental conditions (ambient temperature, humidity)\n2. Surface temperature measurements may not perfectly correlate with core body temperature\n3. Individual variations in facial anatomy and blood flow patterns may affect readings\n4. Time of day and recent physical activity may influence temperature measurements\n5. The dataset was collected in controlled clinical settings and may not fully represent real-world screening conditions\n6. Measurement distance and angle can affect thermal reading accuracy",
