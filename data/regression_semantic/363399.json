  "dataset_name": "QSAR_Bioconcentration_regression",
  "description": "This dataset contains molecular descriptors and bioconcentration factors (BCF) for various chemical compounds. It's used to develop Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models to predict how chemicals accumulate in aquatic organisms relative to their concentration in water. This is crucial for environmental risk assessment and toxicology studies.",

  "dataset_history": "This dataset was compiled to support the development of QSAR models for predicting bioconcentration factors, which became increasingly important after the implementation of REACH legislation in the EU requiring assessment of chemical bioaccumulation potential. The data combines experimental BCF measurements with computed molecular descriptors.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations include:\n1. The dataset contains only organic compounds\n2. Molecular descriptors are computed using standardized chemical structures\n3. BCF values are experimental measurements which may have some inherent measurement uncertainty\n4. The model assumes chemical equilibrium conditions\n5. Predictions may be less reliable for compounds structurally dissimilar to the training set\n6. The dataset is relatively well-balanced across the BCF range",
