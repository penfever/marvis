  "dataset_history": "This dataset is part of the UK's long-term air quality monitoring program, which began in the 1970s. The data collection follows EU directive requirements for air quality monitoring and reporting. The monitoring network was significantly expanded in the 2000s to provide better coverage of urban areas and major pollution sources. The year 2017 data is particularly significant as it represents a period of increased focus on urban air quality issues in the UK.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations include:\n1. Missing values may occur due to equipment maintenance or malfunction\n2. Measurements can be affected by local conditions and weather patterns\n3. Urban stations typically show higher readings than rural ones\n4. Seasonal variations are common with higher readings in winter\n5. Data quality follows strict QA/QC procedures set by DEFRA\n6. Some monitoring stations may be positioned near known pollution sources, creating potential sampling bias\n7. The hourly temporal resolution allows for analysis of daily and seasonal patterns",
