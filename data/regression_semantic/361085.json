  "dataset_name": "sulfur",
  "description": "This dataset comes from a sulfur recovery unit (SRU) in chemical processing. SRUs are critical environmental protection systems that remove harmful sulfur compounds from acid gas streams in industrial processes, particularly in oil refineries and natural gas plants. The system converts toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into elemental sulfur, which can be safely handled and sold as a chemical product.",

  "dataset_history": "This dataset appears to be collected from real industrial process monitoring of a sulfur recovery unit. It was included in a benchmark study of tabular deep learning models. SRU data is valuable for process optimization and environmental compliance monitoring.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations:\n1. Data likely represents steady-state operation of the SRU\n2. Feature relationships are likely non-linear due to complex chemical reactions\n3. Target variable (H2S concentration) is critical for environmental compliance\n4. Original feature names were anonymized, limiting detailed interpretation\n5. Dataset may not capture all process upsets or edge cases\n6. Time series aspects of the process may have been removed in preprocessing\n7. Model predictions should be interpreted with safety margins for environmental compliance",
