  "inference_notes": "Important considerations include:\n1. Location data is intentionally anonymized by truncating to nearest hundred block\n2. Some records may contain inaccuracies due to manual transcription from paper reports\n3. Missing values are often coded as (0,0) for coordinates\n4. There may be reporting bias in certain areas or for certain types of crimes\n5. The time between occurrence and reporting can vary significantly\n6. Demographic information may be incomplete or based on initial observations\n7. The dataset primarily represents reported crimes, not all actual crimes that occurred",
