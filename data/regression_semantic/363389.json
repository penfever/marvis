  "description": "This dataset is derived from OpenSubtitles, a large collection of movie subtitles. It focuses on analyzing character dialogue and gender representation in movie subtitles, specifically looking at gender bias and character interactions. The dataset has been processed to identify character mentions and infer gender information, with the goal of studying gender-based patterns in movie dialogues.",

  "dataset_history": "The dataset was created from OpenSubtitles, one of the largest collections of movie subtitles. The processing pipeline involved identifying character mentions in English subtitles and inferring gender information using two methods: 1) gender kinship terms (e.g., daughter, son) and 2) name-based gender probability distributions derived from US baby names data. This processed data was then used to study gender-based patterns and potentially bias in movie dialogues.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations:\n1. Gender inference is based on binary assumptions and US-centric naming conventions, which may not accurately represent all characters or cultures\n2. The features appear to be encoded/embedded representations rather than raw text, suggesting pre-processing\n3. The large number of instances (442,101) suggests comprehensive coverage across many movies\n4. The ternary nature of the target variable suggests a simplified categorization of complex gender-related patterns\n5. The dataset likely inherits biases present in movie industry representation\n6. The feature names (0-4) suggest this is a processed version of more detailed original data",
