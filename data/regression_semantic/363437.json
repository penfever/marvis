  "dataset_history": "This appears to be a synthetic dataset created for educational and analytical purposes to help understand climate change relationships. While based on real climate science principles, the data points are likely generated to demonstrate typical patterns and relationships between climate variables rather than representing actual historical measurements.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations:\n1. As a synthetic dataset, relationships between variables may be simplified compared to real-world complexity\n2. The dataset appears designed for regression analysis to predict sea level rise based on other climate indicators\n3. Variables are likely normalized or scaled to make them suitable for machine learning\n4. The 10,000 instances suggest a balanced dataset suitable for training models\n5. Users should be aware that real-world climate relationships are often more complex and involve additional variables not included here",
