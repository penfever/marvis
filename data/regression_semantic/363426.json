  "dataset_history": "The BIOSSES dataset was created to address the specific challenges of semantic similarity assessment in biomedical text. The sentences were carefully selected from biomedical literature and annotated by domain experts. It has become an important benchmark dataset for evaluating biomedical NLP systems and is part of the larger BIGBIO framework for biomedical natural language processing.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations:\n1. The dataset is relatively small (100 pairs) but carefully curated\n2. Annotations were done by multiple domain experts to ensure reliability\n3. Biomedical domain knowledge is crucial for understanding the semantic relationships\n4. The similarity scores are subjective and based on human judgment\n5. The dataset is specifically focused on biomedical terminology and concepts\n6. Models trained on general text similarity tasks may need domain adaptation for this dataset",
