  "inference_notes": "Important considerations:\n1. Short time span (2020-2024) may limit long-term trend analysis\n2. Monthly aggregation may mask daily variations\n3. Global averages may obscure regional variations\n4. Data likely comes from multiple measurement systems and satellites\n5. Sea surface temperature predictions should consider seasonal cycles and regional effects\n6. Small sample size (45 instances) may limit some modeling approaches\n7. Feature names are not clearly labeled in the source, requiring domain expertise for interpretation",
