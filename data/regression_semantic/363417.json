The dataset is used to predict mortality by heart failure and includes 13 clinical features that are commonly collected during follow-up visits.",

The data was collected to study mortality prediction in heart failure patients and has become an important benchmark dataset for medical predictive modeling.",
  "inference_notes": "The dataset has some important considerations: 1) It represents a specific geographic population in Pakistan, which may affect generalizability, 2) The follow-up period varies among patients, 3) Some features like smoking status are self-reported and may have reporting bias, 4) The dataset is relatively small (299 instances) which may affect model robustness, 5) There's class imbalance in the death_event outcome which should be considered in classification tasks.",
