  "dataset_history": "This dataset appears to be compiled as part of a broader investigation into the relationship between social media usage and mental health outcomes. It combines WHO suicide statistics with social media metrics, using 2010 as a baseline year, likely chosen because it represents a period when social media usage began to accelerate globally.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations:\n1. Small sample size (30 instances) limits statistical power\n2. Correlation does not imply causation - many confounding variables may exist\n3. Social media metrics may be aggregated across platforms\n4. Geographic and cultural factors may not be fully captured\n5. Reporting biases in suicide statistics vary by country/region\n6. Social media usage data may have collection inconsistencies\n7. The 2010 baseline choice may affect interpretation of trends",
