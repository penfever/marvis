  "dataset_history": "The dataset was collected as part of a master's thesis research project focused on smart agriculture and IoT applications. Data was gathered from a specially equipped greenhouse using various IoT sensors and monitoring devices. The project appears to be part of broader research into precision agriculture and smart farming techniques at Tikrit University.",
  "inference_notes": "Important considerations:\n1. The data represents real-world greenhouse conditions and may contain natural environmental variations\n2. Sensor calibration and maintenance details are not provided but could affect measurements\n3. The numbered feature names (0-12) suggest this might be a processed version of the original dataset\n4. The large number of instances (37,922) indicates extensive monitoring over time\n5. The relationship between water level and other environmental parameters is likely complex and non-linear\n6. Local climate conditions in Iraq may influence the patterns in the data",
