  "inference_notes": "Important considerations:\n1. Prices may be affected by seasonal factors and promotions not captured in the features\n2. Text-derived features (0-3) likely contain compressed information from product descriptions\n3. Customer ratings and review counts may have selection bias\n4. The dataset represents historical pricing which may not reflect current market conditions\n5. Some categorical features are encoded numerically, requiring careful interpretation\n6. The relationship between product attributes and price may not be purely linear due to brand positioning and market factors",
